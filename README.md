# zx_landscape

This 100% ASM code is used for rendering a 2d landscape based on an array. The idea was to call this machine code from Spectrum Basic for fast image rendering. But, still, the generation of the landscape array is made with zx Basic, using RANDOMIZE function for procedural generation. In this repository a demo program is included (.z80 snapshot) for use with a ZX Spectrum 48K emulator. In future the random generator will be created in assembler as well.
